## Genetic and ecogeographic controls on species cohesion in Australiaâ€™s most diverse lizard radiation

This repository contains information associated with the manuscript above, currently under review in The American Naturalist (April 2021).

The following information is provided:

1. R and Unix shell scripts used to prepare and filter the data and perform all analyses;

2. Sample information;

3. Filtered and assembled genetic (ddRAD) data;

4. Climatic and biome data extracted from the localities of sampled individuals or taxon range polygons;

5. Outputs from phylogenetic, genetic structure, and OTU delimitation analyses;
